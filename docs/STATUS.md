# Implementation status

Full V1 goal: **in progress**. Gate A has passed its quality gate; Gates B–F remain.

| Gate | Status | Evidence / remaining work |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A — Clipboard core | Accepted | 20 tests, clean signed native build, private-board UI smoke and final independent review passed. Git milestone: `feat: complete clipboard core`. |
| B — Persistence/search | Next | SQLite repository, migrations, retention, restart persistence and search remain. |
| C — Keyboard workflow | Not started | Requires accepted Gate B. |
| D — Automatic paste | Not started | Requires accepted Gate C. |
| E — Full V1 | Not started | Requires accepted Gate D. |
| F — Polish/distribution | Not started | Requires accepted Gate E and full final audit. |

## Environment

Verified on 2026-09-11: macOS 26.6.2, Swift 6.3.3, Xcode 26.6.
Use `DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer` for Xcode commands.
`git ls-remote --heads origin` succeeded and returned an empty remote.

## Decisions

- Preserve the provided product/architecture requirements; neutral internal name `ClipboardManager`.
- SwiftUI native application with local `ClipboardCore` package; no third-party dependencies.
- Initial validation uses synthetic fixtures and private named pasteboards, never the user's clipboard.
- macOS pasteboard consent must be surfaced; restoration will use `.currentHostOnly` to prevent
  Universal Clipboard propagation of restored history. See `NATIVE_API_NOTES.md` for sources.
- Native UI, permissions, multiple displays and sleep/wake checks will be recorded when their gates arrive.

## Gate A acceptance — 2026-09-11

- Final independent review passed after fixes for initial denied access, timer cleanup and empty restore preflight.
- Main's final full test run passed all **20 XCTest tests** with Swift warnings treated as errors:
  `DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer swift test --parallel -Xswiftc -warnings-as-errors`.
- Main's clean Xcode Debug build passed with `-destination 'platform=macOS,arch=arm64'`,
  `-derivedDataPath build/DerivedData`, and `CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=YES`.
- `codesign --verify --strict` passed for the resulting native `.app`; minimum OS is 26.0.
- Xcode used local ad-hoc signing with no paid developer team. Review found only native Apple/Swift dependencies.
- Native Debug application smoke check used `--test-pasteboard` with a dedicated synthetic board:
  text appeared via the live timer; a repeated copy kept one row; a URL became the newest row;
  a concealed fixture was omitted. The SwiftUI window was visually inspected. Normal quit exited cleanly.
- The smoke fixture was released after validation. No real user clipboard payload was used as a fixture.
- The final clean app was relaunched after the access/lifecycle changes; live capture and normal quit passed.
- Empty restore was reproduced as a failing test before its preflight fix; the final 20-test suite includes
  verification that both the previous content and pasteboard version remain intact.

## Git milestone

Branch: `main`. Accepted milestone commit subject: `feat: complete clipboard core`.
Use Git history and the configured remote to verify its commit hash and publication; the milestone cannot
contain its own hash. No generated build artifacts are included.

## Outstanding evidence

Gate A checks used isolated named pasteboards. The real General Clipboard consent alert/System Settings
interaction was not changed or manually exercised; access policy transitions were tested through the
actual boundary with injected policy values. No production clipboard payload was used for verification.

Persistence/search, panel/global shortcut, keyboard actions, auto-paste/Accessibility, full menu/settings,
rich content, exclusions, multiple displays/sleep-wake, final appearance/performance and distribution
remain tracked in `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` and `REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md`.
